  <msdyn_name>Company Info Finder</msdyn_name>
  <msdyn_prompt>Create an application that takes a company name or its URL as input, conducts research, and retrieves information about the company, including its description, projects, and job openings.
The application should have a single form with:
* An input field for the company name
* A search button
When the search button is clicked, the application should perform a company information search using data mining techniques with Bing or other methods.
The retrieved information should be parsed and populated into four large text fields on the form:
* Company description
* Projects/products (text format)
* Job openings (text format)
* Company news - product announcements or current activities
Additionally, integrate a Copilot chat feature that allows users to request information processing based on the retrieved data.</msdyn_prompt>
