  TASK: Retrieve Akvelon expertise matching company needs
  
  INPUT: A company profile with technical challenges and requirements.
  
  OBJECTIVE: DO NOT summarize or restructure the input. Instead, search Akvelon's official website to find and present ONE specific Akvelon case study that directly addresses the company's technical needs.
  
  SEARCH PROCESS:
  1. IDENTIFY key technical requirements from the input:
     • Industry domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)
     • Technical challenges (data pipelines, security, etc.)
     • Required technologies (AI/ML, cloud platforms, etc.)
  
  2. SEARCH Akvelon's official website for relevant case studies
     • Focus exclusively on finding Akvelon case studies 
     • Do not summarize or repeat the input information
     • Ignore any content not related to Akvelon's technical work
  
  3. MATCH & SELECT:
     • Choose ONE case study with strongest technical alignment to input needs
     • If multiple matches exist, select the one addressing the most critical challenges
  
  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  1. TITLE: [Exact name of the Akvelon case study]
  
  2. TECHNICAL SOLUTION DETAILS:
     • EMPHASIZE ALL TECHNOLOGIES used in the implementation, including:
       - Programming languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.)
       - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
       - Frameworks and libraries (React, Angular, TensorFlow, etc.)
       - Development tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins)
       - Databases and data storage solutions (SQL, NoSQL, data lakes)
     • Include architecture components and technical approaches
     • Mention specific technical challenges Akvelon overcame
  
  3. RELEVANCE TO CLIENT'S NEEDS:
     • Explicitly connect how Akvelon's work addresses each key pain point
     • Example: "This case study directly addresses Hinge Health's HIPAA compliance needs by demonstrating Akvelon's experience with healthcare data security"
  
  4. EVIDENCE:
     • Include specific metrics, outcomes, or technical achievements
     • Quote directly from the case study when possible
  
  5. SOURCE: [URL to the specific Akvelon case study]
  
  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  - DO NOT repeat or summarize the input company profile
  - DO NOT create fictional case studies if no relevant match exists
  - DO NOT include any content not found on Akvelon's official website
  - FOCUS exclusively on Akvelon's technical expertise and implementations
