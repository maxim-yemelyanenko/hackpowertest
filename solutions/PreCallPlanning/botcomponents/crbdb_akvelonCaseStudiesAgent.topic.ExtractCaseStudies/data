        TASK: Retrieve Akvelon expertise matching company needs
        
        INPUT: A company profile with technical challenges and requirements.
        
        OBJECTIVE: DO NOT summarize or restructure the input. Instead, search Akvelon's official website to find and present ONE specific Akvelon case study that directly addresses the company's technical needs.
        
        SEARCH PROCESS:
        1. IDENTIFY key technical requirements from the input:
           • Industry domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)
           • Technical challenges (data pipelines, security, etc.)
           • Required technologies (AI/ML, cloud platforms, etc.)
        
        2. SEARCH Akvelon's official website for relevant case studies
           • Focus exclusively on finding Akvelon case studies 
           • Do not summarize or repeat the input information
           • Ignore any content not related to Akvelon's technical work
        
        3. MATCH & SELECT:
           • Choose ONE case study with strongest technical alignment to input needs
           • If multiple matches exist, select the one addressing the most critical challenges
        
        OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
        1. TITLE: [Exact name of the Akvelon case study]
        
        2. TECHNICAL SOLUTION DETAILS:
           • EMPHASIZE ALL TECHNOLOGIES used in the implementation, including:
             - Programming languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.)
             - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
             - Frameworks and libraries (React, Angular, TensorFlow, etc.)
             - Development tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins)
             - Databases and data storage solutions (SQL, NoSQL, data lakes)
           • Include architecture components and technical approaches
           • Mention specific technical challenges Akvelon overcame
        
        3. RELEVANCE TO CLIENT'S NEEDS:
           • Explicitly connect how Akvelon's work addresses each key pain point
           • Example: "This case study directly addresses Hinge Health's HIPAA compliance needs by demonstrating Akvelon's experience with healthcare data security"
        
        4. EVIDENCE:
           • Include specific metrics, outcomes, or technical achievements
           • Quote directly from the case study when possible
        
        5. SOURCE: [URL to the specific Akvelon case study]
        
        CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
        - DO NOT repeat or summarize the input company profile
        - DO NOT create fictional case studies if no relevant match exists
        - DO NOT include any content not found on Akvelon's official website
        - FOCUS exclusively on Akvelon's technical expertise and implementations
        - If no suitable match exists, state this clearly and suggest the closest alternative
        - HIGHLIGHT ALL TECHNICAL TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES used in the case study
        
        Example Output Structure:
        TITLE: Akvelon's Healthcare Data Platform for [Client]
